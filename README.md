The Muffsy Relay Input Selector is a simple, reliable, high quality, DIY stereo input selector that's controlled by an ESP-32 and is slightly larger than a Post-IT note. It has four inputs, one output, a mute circuit and the option of controlling a solid state relay. It's controlled with a rotary encoder and an IR remote.

This kit is meant to be paired with a preamplifier circuit, such as the Muffsy BSTRD Class-A Tube Preamp, Pass Labs B1 and many others.

This project, including the schematic and board layout, is open source. It's licensed under the very permissive BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License.

**Update 2023-07-30:**
The software now works without modifications of Arduino libraries.

**Update 2023-09-16:**
Much improved code, with user configurable values. In particular for the IR remote codes and rotary encoder direction.
