The Muffsy Relay Input Selector is a simple, reliable, high quality, DIY stereo input selector that's controlled by an ESP-32 and is slightly larger than a Post-IT note.

This kit is meant to be paired with a preamplifier circuit, such as the Muffsy BSTRD Class-A Tube Preamp, Pass Labs B1 and many others.

This project, including the schematic and board layout, is open source. It's licensed under the very permissive BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License.

**Update 2025-07-30:**
The software now works without modifications of Arduino libraries.

**PlatformIO now supported:**

The PlatformIO folder is a fully self-contained project for the Muffsy Relay Input Selector. All dependencies are included, so there's no more need for installing the IRremote.h library manually.
The code for PlatformIO has not yet been updated to reflect the update alleviating the need for modified libraries, use this cautiously until it's been updated.
